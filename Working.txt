# This is an Ardiuno based RC Robotic Arm Project, which uses a microcontroller(Arduino), servo's,
12v power supply, RC transmitter, RC reciver , etc. Robotic Arm is connected to a Rc reciver which
recives signals transmitted by Rc transmitter and works according to the source code and makes the
servo's move according to the program.

# It basically works with RF(Rc) signals, Rc transmitter first reads the position of its joystick's
and according to the position of its joysticks it transmittes RF signals, which later recived by Rc
reciver. After, reciving signals from transmitter reciver according to its source code or program
checks the signal and works according to the code and makes the servo or any other part connected
to reciver moves according to source code.

# In this case Rc transmitter transmites values, which later recived by Rc reciver and then reciver
according to its source code make the robotic arm move according to program. Ex. If transmitter sends
signal to make the robotic arm move in forward direction then reciver will recive the signal and make
the robotic arm move in forward direction accoeding to its program.
