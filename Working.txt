# This is an Ardiuno based RC Robotic Arm Project, which uses a microcontroller(Arduino), servo's,
12v power supply, RC transmitter, RC reciver , etc. Robotic Arm is connected to a Rc reciver which
recives signals transmitted by Rc transmitter and works according to the source code and makes the
servo's move according to the program.
